// Appending Variables to Strings

// Change code below this line
const someAdjective = "Free Code Camp";
let myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;

// Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, 
// we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) .
